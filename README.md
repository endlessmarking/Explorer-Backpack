# Explorer Backpack

## Project Overview
The Explorer Backpack attaches to the top of the WCH CH32V307V development board using the available pin headers. The backpack contains a variety of sensors that can be accessed using the boards GPIO pins. This project is intended to help people learn about interfacing with a variety of peripherals. With a little imagination it could be used to create a variety of projects such as a decorative light, data logger, TV remote, monitoring and a home automation system.
